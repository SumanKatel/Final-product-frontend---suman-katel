              Together with our partners Cartell, we use data from thousands of
              Carzone's live and historic stock to calculate the estmt market
              value of a car. Carzone car valuations are recommended for
              guidance purposes only. We use details such as the year and
              mileage to work out the approximate market value, however there
              are many other factors that may impact the carâ€™s value including
              the following.
